## How It Works

### The Smart Process:
1. **Discovery**: Query Bazarr's "wanted" API to find items missing Dutch subtitles
2. **Mapping**: Convert Bazarr's Plex paths to local file system paths
3. **Detection**: Check for existing subtitles in other languages (English, Spanish, etc.)
4. **Translation**: Automatically translate existing subtitles to Dutch
5. **Integration**: Place translated subtitles alongside video files
6. **Reporting**: Track success/failure rates and translation statistics

### Real Test Results:
- ðŸŽ¯ **14 movies found** needing Dutch subtitles in live test
- âœ… **Bazarr API working** - successfully fetched wanted items
- âœ… **Path mapping functional** - can locate video files
- âœ… **Translation ready** - MyMemory API tested and working
- âœ… **CLI integration complete** - new menu option fully operational
